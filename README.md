# Introduction to Computer Systems
This is the repository for my work in CMSC 15400, Introduction to Computer Systems, which is modeled after a course with the same name at CMU.
There were 5 projects:
p1bitmanip (bit-level arithmetic and manipulations),
p2bomb (assembly code "deciphering"),
p3cache (cache simulator and matrix transposition optimization),
p4shell (simple shell that supports some built in commands and running new programs),
p5malloc (a dynamic memory allocator implemented with 15 segregated doubly linked list and first-fit policy).
